## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/artificial-intelligence-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd artificial-intelligence-projects
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (for practicals):
   - Ensure **Python 3.11** is installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
     ```
   - For Teachable Machine, use the online tool; no local install needed.
   - Run Python scripts:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

4. **Explore the assignments**:
   - Each assignment folder contains documents (.pdf/.docx), Python code (.py) where applicable, README with objectives, instructions, and outputs.
   - Theoretical assignments include Word/PDF reports; practicals include code and screenshots.
