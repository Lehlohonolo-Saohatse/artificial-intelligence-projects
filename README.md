A collection of theoretical and practical assignments completed for the  
**CMPG 313 – Artificial Intelligence** module at North-West University.

This repository showcases implementations and analyses in **Python** and conceptual work, covering search algorithms, machine learning, clustering, first-order logic, and AI history. Practical assignments include Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for interactive code and visualizations.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lehlohonolo-Saoahatse/artificial-intelligence-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd artificial-intelligence-projects
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (for practicals):
   - Ensure **Python 3.11** is installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
     ```
   - For .ipynb files (e.g., clustering), use Jupyter:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook assignment_notebook.ipynb
     ```
   - Run Python scripts:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

4. **Explore the assignments**:
   - Each assignment folder contains documents (.pdf/.docx), Python code (.py), Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) where applicable, README with objectives, instructions, and outputs.
   - Theoretical assignments include Word/PDF reports; practicals include code, notebooks, and screenshots.

## 🧪 Assignments Overview
- **[Theory Assignment 1: AI The Past and the Present](assignments/theory_assignment1_ai_history/)**  
  Explores AI history (key events like Turing Test) and current applications (e.g., healthcare, NLP), with challenges like data bias.

- **[Theory Assignment 2: Search Problems](assignments/theory_assignment2_search_problems/)**  
  Formulates search problems (campus navigation, event planning, library retrieval); applies BFS and IDDFS on a graph.

- **[Theory Assignment 3: A* Search](assignments/theory_assignment3_astar_search/)**  
  Implements A* with heuristic on a city graph, showing calculations and trees.

- **[Practical Assignment 1: Teachable Machine](assignments/practical_assignment1_teachable_machine/)**  
  Trains an ML model for object/action recognition, analyzes data and accuracy.

- **[Practical Assignment 2: Clustering Random Data](assignments/practical_assignment2_clustering_random_data/)**  
  Generates data, applies KMeans, visualizes clusters; .ipynb saved for experiments.

- **[Practical Assignment 3: Clustering Fitness Tracker Data](assignments/practical_assignment3_clustering_fitness_tracker/)**  
  Simulates user data, clusters with KMeans, analyzes groups; .ipynb for plots.

- **[Practical Assignment 4: FOL-Based Healthcare Chatbot](assignments/practical_assignment4_fol_chatbot/)**  
  Builds chatbot with FOL rules for diagnosis; .ipynb optional for enhanced interaction.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python 3.11**: For practical implementations (clustering, FOL).
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Tools**: Teachable Machine (online), Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for data tasks.
- **Git**: For version control.
